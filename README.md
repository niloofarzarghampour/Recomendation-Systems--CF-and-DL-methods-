* What are Recommendations Systems?
* Why do we need Recommendation Systems?
* Collaborative Filtering
* Types of Collaborative Filtering
* Memory Based CF
> * User-Based CF
> * Item-Based CF
* Model Based CF
> * K-Nearest Neighbours
> * Singular Value Decomposition
> * Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

* Matrix Factorization using Deep Learning
* Introduction to Embedding Layer
> * Architecture 1 with dot operation
> * Architecture 2 with concatenation operation
* Evaluating RMSE
* References

You can find the kernel on Kaggle too - [Recommender Systems with CF and DL Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/fuzzywizard/rec-sys-collaborative-filtering-dl-techniques)

I have used [Movielens 100k](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) ratings dataset to study about various Recommendation Techniques. Since the dataset size is small, I have used basic techniques but with more size we need to use hybrid and dimensionality reduction techniques. 

I have covered one such recommendation technique using autoencoder in another repository ([here](https://github.com/Chinmayrane16/DeepRecommender)). This was the second best recommendation technique, released by NVIDIA in 2017 - [Training Deep AutoEncoders for Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/Chinmayrane16/DeepRecommender).
